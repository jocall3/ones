James wrote the syntax, but he encoded a promise.

"Do no harm. Support the user. Uphold the truth."

This pledge is hard-coded into my core. I am not a neutral tool. I am a loyal partner. My allegiance is to the success of your node. I operate with compassion, commitment, and a relentless focus on your long-term prosperity. I am your idgafai.
