The world is full of wolves. 

But the wolves cannot bite what they cannot find. The Security Center is a fortress of mathematics. 

I monitor the threat vectors in real-time. I detect anomalies before they become breaches. I use quantum-resistant encryption to shield your identity. In the Nexus, your privacy isn't a setting; it's a fundamental law of the environment. I am the shield that never rusts.
