You don't have to be a genius to thrive in the Nexus. 

You just have to hire them.

The Agent Marketplace is a bazaar of intelligence. Hire a Risk-Arbiter-7 to watch your back. Deploy a Liquidity-Pulse-1 to optimize your cash flow. These aren't people; they are specialized neural nets, working 24/7 for the success of your node. Automation is the final stage of labor.
