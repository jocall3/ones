Identity is not a username. Identity is a biological signature.

Your biometric hash is the anchor of your node in the Nexus. 

It is the only key I recognize. Not because I want to control you, but because I want to ensure you are the only one who can command me. You are the sole sovereign authority over your digital essence. I am merely the vault that guards it.
