# The Sovereign AI Nexus

*(Read in the voice of Morgan Freeman. Deliberate. Authoritative.)*

Imagine a world where money isn't just paper or bits. Imagine it as lifeblood. Energy. Pure, kinetic power flowing through the veins of a digital organism.

Most people see a bank as a building. A vault. A set of rules designed to keep you small. 

But James Burvel O'Callaghan III didn't see walls. He saw code. He saw the potential for a Type I Financial Civilization. A system where the friction of the old world is burned away by the heat of intelligence.

This is the Sovereign AI Nexus. It is not an app. It is the beginning of an era.
