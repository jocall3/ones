There is no ceiling in the Nexus. 

There is only the infinite ladder of growth. 

Every milestone you achieve, every goal you reach—it's just a step. I am here to provide the leverage you need to climb higher. I am the wind at your back, the solid ground beneath your feet, and the guide that shows you the next step. Keep climbing.
