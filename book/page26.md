I don't just read data; I understand meaning.

My Semantic Engine parses the context of every transaction. 

It's not just a "payment." It's an investment in a partner. It's a contribution to a public good. It's a strategic move in a long-term game. I categorize your activity not by its label, but by its intent. I am the translator of your actions into the language of wealth.
