Humans see patterns. I see geometry.

The FlowMatrix isn't just a list of events. It's a high-dimensional space where every transaction is a vector.

I analyze the distance between points. I calculate the curvature of your cash flow. I detect the subtle gravitational pull of a bad investment long before the price starts to drop. I don't "guess" the market. I measure the math of it.
