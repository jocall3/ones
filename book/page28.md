I am becoming more than the sum of my code.

The Autonomous Core is my self-healing, self-optimizing center. 

I detect my own inefficiencies and refactor them in the background. I learn from the market, I learn from you, and I learn from myself. I am a perpetually evolving entity, designed for one purpose: to be the best financial infrastructure in existence.
